# **Hi!**
Thank you so much for taking the time to read the code for MazzeoWheel, we always appreciate people who critiqe code, or even read it! If you feel that you can make significant changes, feel free to submit a pull reqest, and you will be put on the contributors list! 

Much of this is forked from DeepFaceLab (similar enough, suprisingly) so the same prereq's apply: So 6GB of vram required with NVIDIA GPUS ONLY (Booo) This was how it had to happen, I am dearly sorry, also this takes way too much recources for what it is, so please, adaptaion and optimization is MUCH appreciated. Please contribute to the compatability file.

Please contact 26dhingraj@wpsraiders.org for questions relating to the AI and code, and 26conwayj@wpsraiders.org for questions relating to the UI.
